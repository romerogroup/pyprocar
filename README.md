PyProcar
===========

PyProcar is a robust, open-source Python library used for pre- and post-processing of the electronic structure data coming from DFT calculations. PyProcar provides a set of functions that manage data obtained from the PROCAR format. Basically, the PROCAR format is a projection of the Kohn-Sham states over atomic orbitals. That projection is performed to every k-point in the considered mesh, every energy band and every atom. PyProcar is capable of performing a multitude of tasks including plotting plain and spin/atom/orbital projected band structures and Fermi surfaces- both in 2D and 3D, Fermi velocity plots, unfolding bands of a super  cell, comparing band structures from multiple DFT calculations, plotting partial density of states and generating a k-path for a given crystal structure.

Currently supports:

1. VASP
2. Elk (Stll in development)
3. Quantum Espresso
4. Abinit (DOS Stll in development)
5. Lobster (Stll in development)
