Notice
===========
- **New Release** We recently updated to a new version 'v6.2.1'.
- **Support for Previous Versions**: For users who prefer to continue with an older version, we have conveniently archived the previous releases on GitHub, and provided a link to the corresponding documentation.


PyProcar
===========

PyProcar is a robust, open-source Python library used for pre- and post-processing of the electronic structure data coming from DFT calculations. PyProcar provides a set of functions that manage data obtained from the PROCAR format. Basically, the PROCAR format is a projection of the Kohn-Sham states over atomic orbitals. That projection is performed to every k-point in the considered mesh, every energy band and every atom. PyProcar is capable of performing a multitude of tasks including plotting plain and spin/atom/orbital projected band structures and Fermi surfaces- both in 2D and 3D, Fermi velocity plots, unfolding bands of a super  cell, comparing band structures from multiple DFT calculations, plotting partial density of states and generating a k-path for a given crystal structure.

Currently supports:

1. VASP
2. Elk (Stll in development)
3. Quantum Espresso
4. Abinit (DOS Stll in development)
5. Lobster (Stll in development)

Dependencies
------------
matplotlib <br />
numpy <br />
scipy <br />

Installation
------------

with pip:

	pip install pyprocar

with conda:

    conda install -c conda-forge pyprocar

Usage
-----
Typical use is as follows

    import pyprocar
    pyprocar.bandsplot(code='vasp',mode='plain', dirname='bands')

Previously, bandsplot would accept the OUTCAR and PROCAR file paths as inputs,
in v6.0.0 we moved to specifying the directory where the bands calculation took place.

Refer to the documentation for further details.

Stand-alone mode:

    procar.py -h

will bring a help menu.
