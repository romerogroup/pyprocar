Plotting Inverse participation ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often it is needed to search for **localized** modes within the band structure, typical examples are surface/interface states and defect levels. 
The usual procedure for detecting them is looking for bands with a large projection around the atoms at the surface or defect. 
This procedure is both cumbersome for the user and error-prone. For instance, the lowest unoccupied levels
of the neutral :math:`C_N` defect in h-BN has practically no projection on the defect atom and its nearest neighbors. 
This delayed its identification as a single-photon emitter.[jara2021,auburger2021] 
A much simpler way to detect these localized levels is by means of the **Inverse Participation Ratio**, defined as

.. math::
  IPR_{nk} = \\frac{\sum_{a} |c_{nki}|^4}{\\left(\sum_a c_{nka}\\right)^2}

where the indexes :math:`n,k,a` are the band, k-point and atom, respectively. 
This function has been extensively applied in the context of Anderson localization.[Evers2000] 
However, can capture any kind of localization. A perfectly localized state -**i.e.** 
localized in a single atom- would have :math:`IPR=1`, but a fully extended state has :math:`IPR=\\frac{1}{N}`, with :math:`N` the total number of atoms.

Preparation
-----------
Before diving into plotting, we need to download the example files. 
Use the following code to do this. Once downloaded, specify the `data_dir` to point to the location of the downloaded data.

# Setting up the environment

# First, we will import the necessary libraries and set up our data directory path.

import os

import pyprocar

# Define the directory containing the example data

# Topologically-protected surface states in :math:`Bi_2Se_3`
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# The first example is the detection of topologically-protected surface states in :math:`Bi_2Se_3`, [zhang2009].
# The whole slab has six van der Waals layers (quintuple layers), each is five atom thick. The surface states localize on the outer quintuple layers,
# in contrast a extended state cover the six quintuple layers.
# The ratio between the localization of both types of states is 1 to 3, and the $IPR$ has enough resolution to provide a clear visual identification.
# The PyProcar code is:

    dirname=bi2se3_data_dir,
    elimit=[-1.0, 1.0],
    mode="ipr",

#  :math:`NV^-` defect in diamond
# ---------------------------------
#
# The second example is the :math:`NV^-` defect in diamond, it is a negatively charged N substitution plus an adjacent vacancy.
# This defect if of interest as a source of single photons. Its ground state is a triplet, allowing the control of the spin by microwave radiation.[DOHERTY2013]
# The supercell has 215 atoms, hence :math:`IPR\to0` for bulk states (blue lines).
# Several defect levels lie within the fundamental band gap of diamond (dark red lines). The closest levels to the Fermi energy are double degenerate (**i.e.** triplet),
# but only occupied for the spin majority. Hence, according to the optical transition takes place between the bands with index :math:`430\to431` or :math:`430\to432`
# of the spin channel labelled `spin-1`. The calculation of the main emission line involves a calculation of the excited state,
# which can be simulated by fixing the occupations of the mentioned levels, **i.e.** the :math:`\Delta` SCFmethod.[Jin2021]
# The pyprocar code is:
